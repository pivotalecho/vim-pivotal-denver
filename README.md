# Pivotal Labs Denver Vim Configuration

This repo was created in an attempt to standarize a vim configuration
for use in the office, and with new clients. This was created out of a
need for a previously bloated and outdated config, so please add
dependencies only after thoughtful consideration.

This config uses Vundle for dependency management, and separates language
specific plugins and their configs into different .bundle and .config
file.

# Installation

In order to install the config, please make sure you have `ag`, a.k.a the silver searcher,
installed on your machine.
